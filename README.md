## Image basics
### what is image??
Image is describe as a 2-D function f(x,y) where (x,y)
are the spatial coordinates and the value of f at any point (x,y)
is proportional to the brightness or gray levels of the image.
  \ x -> [0,h-1], where h is the height of the image
  \ y -> [0,w-1], where w is the width of the image
  \ f(x,y) -> [0,L-1] where L = 256 (for an 8-bit image)
### Image vs Digital image.
The value of f(x,y) will always be a discrete value in digital image but in image may or may not.
